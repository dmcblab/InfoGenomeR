In Version 0.2 add a new function to handle one sample case

In Version 0.3, wrote a C program to perform the bootstrap test

In Version 0.4, add one function to control for the data set with large variance

In Version 0.4.1, readme was added

In Version 0.5, report tumor/expected ratio, 
		added function to scale lambda depending on the noise level of the data
		perform permutation test for two-sample BIC-seq
		for two sample case, always remove the regions according to the expected read count (largly equivalent to remove regions with low mappability)

In Version 0.5.1, use a more stringent scaling factor for the lambda paramamter
		  removed ealier verion of MBIC-seq (ealier than v0.1.5)

In Version 0.5.2, add an option such that a user can specify if he/she want the stringent scaling factor for the lambda parameter or not
		  Fixed a bug in read.c

In Version 0.6, add a function to perform CNV genotyping in given regions.

In Version 0.6.1, modified the method for pvalue assignment of CNV genotyping

In Version 0.6.2, changed the program countRead.c; force the read count in the bad regions as zero.
		  Bad regions means the total size of the bins overlapping the given region is much larger than the given region. 
		  This usually caused by large bin size in the normalized data or low mappability near the given region. 
		  In any case, the genotyping results in these regions are not reliable, and so we set the read count in these regions as zero


In Version 0.6.3, for two sample case, do not filter region by expected read count in segments.
		  for two sampe case, use lambda/2 at the first step the segmentation

IN Version 0.7.2 fixed a bug in reportOneSample.R (for one sample one library case)
